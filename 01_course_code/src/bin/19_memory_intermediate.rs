/*

BASIC memory refresh
---------------------
° Memory is built using binary: bits =  0 OR 1
° computer optimized for bytes: 1 byte = 8 contiguous bits
° Memory fully contiguous

ADDRESSES
----------
 ° All data in memory has an "address":
    - used to locate data
    - address is always the same, only data at this address changes

 ° Usually don't utilize addresses directly:
    - variables handle most of the work


OFFSETS
---------
° Items can be located at an address using an "offset"
° Offsets begin at 0
° Represent the number of bytes away from the original address:
    - normally deal with indexes instead
